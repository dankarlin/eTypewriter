under the jackboots and the fiddlers grinning hideously over \
their canted pieces. Towering over them all is the judge and \
he is naked dancing, his small feet lively and quick and now \
in doubletime and bowing to the ladies, huge and pale and hairless,\
like an enormous infant. He never sleeps, he says. He says \
he’ll never die. He bows to the fiddlers and sashays backwards \
and throws back his head and laughs deep in his throat and \
he is a great favorite, the judge. He wafts his hat and the \
lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lamps and he \
swings about and takes possession of one of the fiddles and \
he pirouettes and makes a pass, two passes, dancing and \
fiddling at once. His feet are light and nimble. He never \
sleeps. He says that he will never die. He dances in light \
and in shadow and he is a great favorite. He never sleeps, \
the judge. He is dancing, dancing. He says that he will never die. \
